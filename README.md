You need to have Node.js installed on your machine.  You can get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Change into both directories and run the following commands in each, in a different shell.  I'm sure you have seen this before. Admitedly it is sub-optimal, finding the best solution is harder than I would have guessed and it's on the to-do list.


```
